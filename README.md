Teaching assignment for WinC FED level 33

I got completely stuck at the end of part 4, and could not get it back in shape, so decided to start again ( and use git more prudently this time ) ;)

Changelog:
* Back to square 1
* On to Square 3
* 4.8, (finally back to point I got stuck last time)
* 4.9, ListItem Click gets registered back in Container
* 4.10_11, it works, thanks to 484113853 (still have to look at exclusive keys)
* 4.12_13, handleClickEmptyCart
* 4.14, added some styling
* a bit of styling
* 5, Added Input Field, and added a check if item was already in Cart
* 6, added amount, (+ capitalize & not too long
* 6+, click in cart also updates the amount of the item
* 7 added a bit of extra styling, no side-by-side on mobile
* (hopefully) final push
* ok, 1 more, clean-up of course, stripped out helper console.log's etc...
* components > Components
